--==[ Introduction ]==--

Welcome to SunFTP Server Project,

Now you may wonder, why the hell another FTP Server?
Well, first of all, it's not just another FTP Server, infact
it's the first of its kind. A brand new project based on Object Pascal
or in other words "Delphi Code".

SSP was first intended as a "School Project". But since I (NGin)
personally never written a fully working FTP Server before, I decided
to share my work with other people and from this stage SSP have been
released as Open Source, anyone can join the project or infact
use the code on their own.

SSP is not using Assembler/C/C++ or other developement tools, no it's
a pure art of work in Object Pascal for Win32, which makes it even
easier to join. Code should be compatible with all versions of
Delphi, but unfortunateley there have been reports on Delphi 3 Std,
Delphi 4 Desktop and Delphi 5 doesn't compile the code correct, but
so let it be.

SSP Offers:

 - Easy user management (thanks to Jan Tomasek)
 - Dirfferent permissions for each user (R/W/D/L)
 - Hide real real PATH from users (thanks to Jan Tomasek)
 - Powerful authorization procedure (thanks to Jan Tomasek)
 - IP based security (thanks to Rasmus Allenheim)
 - Welcome/Goodbye messages (thanks to Jan Tomasek)
 - Enough options for most people
 - Open Source (available under "lesser" GPL)
 - Slick User Interface (SUI)
 - and much more...

If this isn't enough for you, go and look elsewere!

--==[ How can I compile source ]==--

First of all, get yourself a copy of Delphi 3 (Pro or C/S).
Download the components RX Libs from http://rx.demo.ru and install
them, secondly download the components ICS from http://rtfm.be/fpiette
and install them to. Those components are freeware, so get them.

Now you should have a look in the SunFTP Src dir "\Units" there is
a Delphi package ready to install in Delphi 3 (SunFTP.dpl).
Now open the project and press <CTRL>+<F9>, watch the screen for
errors, no one should occur, maybe just some warnings, thats it!

Now run the file "SunFTP.exe" and have fun, if you don't want to
do this, browse to the URL: http://xs4all.dk/sunftp/download.shtml
and download the compiled binary. Doohh.

--==[ About this booklet and other install tips ]==--

First of all, I'm NGin, it was me who started the SunFTP Server Project
in back in July 1999. I have written this document espescially for
you, sorry for my bad english, please don't correct me.
I don't like personally to write help files nor files like this one,
so maybe this document doesn't fit your needs, and I couldn't care less.

There may be some other SSP documents out there in CyberSpace written
by someone else other than me, but I don't know of any, this documents
why.

--==[ First time run ]==--

If you just installed SSP, then click and run the file "SunFTP.exe".
You should now see a Message Dialog saying "Since the.. bla..bla.."
or something like it, now you should see the properties dialog
or configuration screen. Set the options as you want them:

Server ->
 Port:        This is default set to be 21. 21 is used by almost any
              ftp clients today, so leave this in default mode.
 Max Clients: This indicates the maximum of allowed clients to
              be connected to SSP. Default value is set to 10, this
              is enough in most cases. If you enter 0, then the
              number of max clients are infinite. You can have the
              maximum of 999 clients connected to SSP.
 Server msg:  This is the FTP Banner message, goes like:
              220 My FTP Server ready on port 21...
 Restrict IP: This is the message to be shown when a not allowed
              client tries to connect to the FTP Server.

System ->

 Autostart:   This will autostart the FTP Server when it is started.
 Minimize:    Minimize SSP to the system tray when it is minimized
              or launched.
 AutSt.Every: This enables the SSP to be a part of your system, it
              will be launched automatically every Windows session.

Logging ->

 Max lines:   This is the maximum lines to be displayed in the Logfile
              message box, default value is set to 1000 lines, you
              can increase and decrease the value, no max values
              are there.
 Enable:      This enables SSP to save the Logfile message box contents
              to a chosen file. Default name is: ftp.log, change it
              to your own personallt favourite ;)

IP Restriction ->

 Rest.IP's:   This is a list of IP addresses, all the added are being
              let out and the Restrict IP Msg. is showed. Click
              Add, Delete or Clear, button captions explains their
              respective functions.

Messages ->

 Welcome msg: This message is being showed when a client connects
              to the FTP Server, it goes like:

              220-Welcome to xs4all ftp services, all actions on this
              220-ftp server are being logged, now you're warned!
              220
 Goodbye msg: This message is being showed when a client disconnects
              from the FTP Server, just like the welcome message.

Now click "OK" and the FTP Server is ready to be operated, but first we
have to add some users.

Click the "User Manager" button and a new screen should appear.

Now click the "Add" button and the user name "Anonymous" should apear
among with the options:

 Password: ********* (randomized)
 Home directory: SSPDir\users\user_anonymous\
 Permissions: None

Now you can change the password to your own, e.g.: anon
Remember to change the permissions, avail permissions are: R,W,D,L
I would suggest: R,W for anonymous logins

To create a new user, simply click the button "Add" again
To change the home directory, click the button with the folder on it.
Now you can choose directory for the user, to create a new one simply
select dir and right click your mouse button. Thats it.

When you're finished, click on the button "Close" and start the
FTP Server.

--==[ Administer SSP ]==--

To be the administrator of a SSP server isn't hard at all. SSP is cosidered
to be one of the most simple FTP Servers available on the market today
which is still free to use.

When you have started the SSP, you will get the information:

(In the Logfile message box)
1999.08.25 19:02:38 -- FTP Server started (21, 10.10.10.2)
1999.08.25 19:02:38 -- Logging actions to file D:\SunFTP\logs\ftp.log

It may not be like as shown above, but something like it.

Explanation of the logged options:

1999.08.25 19:02:38, is the time of an event
-- FTP Server started (21, 10.10.10.2), is the action taken

In this case we have the information "(21, 10.10.10.2)", which means:
21 is the Port number the FTP Server is running on and the 10.10.10.2
is the IP Address. You can easily get the IP by clicking <ALT>+<I>
The IP address is shown in the logbox as well as it is copied to the
clipboard (paste into any other Win app via <CTRL>+<V>).

To clear the logbox, simply click <ALT>+<R>.
To shutdown the FTP Server immediately, simply click <ALT>+<CTRL>+<T>

Well I guess that's all. To view the saved logfile goto: SSPDir\logs\
and list the file named "ftp.log".
